# onrepeat

This is meant to be a low touch habit tracker the same vein as simple paper based habit trackers.

Still getting the basic premise of the application out of my head and ensuring I can do some basic things with gdscript around figuring out dates and dynamically populating the UI based on the number of habits being tracked and the number of days in the current month.

Everything is hardcoded at the moment. I still need to figure out how I'm going to save and load data, what I want the thing to look like, what restraints I'm going to put on the application. It's meant to be very minimal. It shouldn't be the type of app you spend a lot of time in. You open it up and either figure out what you're going to do or check off something you have done.

I would like to be able to do some things around tracking streaks and modifying the UI based on streaks. We'll see how things progress as I work on this.
