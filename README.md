# onrepeat

This is meant to be a low touch habit tracker in the same vein as simple paper based habit trackers. Development is currently in progress, but core functionality has been implemented.

Creates a basic checkbox grid, for the days of the current month, against the names of the habits being tracked. On performing the desired habit, check off the habit for the current day.

Left click on a habit label to rename. Right click to disable (remove from the UI & stop tracking) or delete (remove from the UI & delete stored data).

Currently limited to six habits. After that, the `new` button is disabled and hidden.
